    "- In our computer systems, we store our files in well-organized hierarchies. We donâ€™t store them all in one location. Likewise, when our s/w application grow, we divide it into packages. In real-life projects, programs are much larger than what we deal with in our journey of learning Python. A package lets us hold similar modules in one place.\n",

    "\n",
    "     - A package is basically a directory having .py file(s) and an additional file with the name _ _ init _ _.py. In Python a directory inside the Python path having a file named _ _ init _ _.py, will be treated as a package by Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- The way a directory can contain subdirectories and files, a Python package can have sub-packages and modules. As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules, we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages. This makes a project (program) easy to manage and conceptually clear.\n",
